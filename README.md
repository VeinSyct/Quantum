# Quantum
Chaos algorithm solutions library allows quantum virtualization.

The quantum virtualization are a mathematical solutions for solving entrophy to emergence in a moment of moments, the moment in moments simulation allows massive computation to occur in simulation.

What is a quantum dimension?

In computer programming quantum dimension is a virtual environment that is a place but doesn't necessarily exist, it is there, but it's not there. Picture this in physics the universe is made of neutrons and electrons which makes an atom and all these atoms are identical because these are made by just one entity a single quantum particle that exist in moment of infinit moments which makes up the entrire observable and unobserved universe. Imagin this, we are one particle that exist in a moment of infinity moments, which accumulate into a random pile of particle in a single moment of moments, our existance is an accident in moment and complete random. So with these idea we write a program to simulate moment of moments to process massive task in a fraction of moment.

Test application:

Artificial intelligence chat application - allows the processing of a natural conversation between human and virtual lifeform by allowing queries to be fragment into keywords and processed to produce a seamless answers that is natural. This process would take massive life cycle but in quantum simulation it would only take a fraction of seconds. 

Electronic cash virtual storage - allows electronic cash data to be stored in virtual simulation which can be access by location in the virtual dimension, imagine a virtual environment like a game or a virtual place where you leave a box some where in a game and to access it you need to go back to the exact place where you left the box.
