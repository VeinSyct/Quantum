# Quantum
Chaos algorithm solutions library allows quantum virtualization.

The quantum virtualization are a mathematical solutions for solving entrophy to emergence in a moment of moments, the moment in moments simulation allows massive computation to occur in simulation.

Test application:

Artificial intelligence chat application - allows the processing of a natural conversation between human and virtual lifeform by allowing queries to be fragment into keywords and processed to produce a seamless answers that is natural. This process would take massive life cycle but in quantum simulation it would only take a fraction of seconds. 

Electronic cash virtual storage - allows electronic cash data to be stored in virtual simulation which can be access by location in the virtual dimension, imagine a virtual environment like a game or a virtual place where you leave a box some where in a game and to access it you need to go back to place where you left the box.
